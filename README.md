# remind_me

A smart reminder app

What is done and what is not (on my end):

Completed-
1. Interface (Navigation Bar + Sliver App Bar + Cupertino Widgets + Overall Foundational Design)
2. Add/Edit/Delete reminders
3. Local notifications
4. Other DateTime parsing methods and checks
5. Bottom Navigation Bar bug fixed 
(i removed the touch functionality there, now it is only page swiping)
6. Notifications work in foreground, background and even when the app is terminated
   (they dont work if the device has been powered off or restarted)
   (I tested on a Samsung M13, worked flawlessly [Android Compile SDK Version 33])

Incomplete/Not Implemented (What y'all have to complete)-
1. Cupertino switch on every reminder works and can be turned on and off but does nothing
   (No functionality or use) (i was thinking of using it to show if a reminder has been enabled/disabled)
2. Database hasn't been implemented, all reminders stay in memory and get deleted when the app is terminated
3. After a reminder gets notified, the reminder doesn't not terminate or gets greyed out 
   (i had something like that in mind, couldn't make it work)
4. Silent/Alarm mode hasn't been implemented (very easy to implement i will leave pointers in T0DO for it)
5. Feature to add/edit notes when setting reminder 
   (You can use TextField or TextFormField the same i used it to take input for reminder name and them in each tile)
6. (Optional)- Remove Pedro Pascal from Menu Screen

In general, get this app ready for Project Review-III as it has sucked every part of my soul like a fucking dementors
from Harry Potter.

I will be making y'all contributors and giving u all total rights to control my repository to make PR's and accept them
or make merges. But I can't code anymore in this retarded ass language. It has taken a heavy toll on my physical
and mental health, I seriously gotta see a doctor or something.

Yours Sincerely
